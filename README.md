# USACO

My USACO things epicly because why not

I've been trying to convert to C++ so there'll be a mix of different languages. Also, ignore package errors for Java, IDK how to fix them but I usually just open the subfolder in VSCode :/

JAN2021 - Silver (paint.java was solved)
FEB2021 - Silver (All 3 work, in contest promotion to Gold, but didn't bother trying Gold b/c it'd just be a waste of time at my skill level lol)
